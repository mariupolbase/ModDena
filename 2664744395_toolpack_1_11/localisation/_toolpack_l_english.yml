 #CPT
 toolpack.1.t:0 "Help"
 toolpack.1.d:0 "Confused? Let me run you through the steps necessary to master the Country Puppeting Tool.\n\nThis tool contains two windows: The "Tool" window, which contains the actual tool and the "Gallery" window which shows an overview of all possible autonomy states. Hover over them to take a look at the necessary requirements.\n\nNow, to the tool. As was mentioned before, most autonomy states require certain conditions. To make things less confusing, the only autonomy options that you will see are the ones that are available. So, don't worry if Germany has different options than Japan.\n\nTo use the tool, first click on a state of a country that you want to be puppeted. Use the mark button to mark it and then click on a state of the country that you want to become the overlord. Finally, choose one of the options to set the marked country to that autonomy state.\n\nThe "Free Country" button can either be used to free all marked countries or the country the state of which you have clicked on.\n\n\nIf you are willing to do a good deed and notice any issues (mainly overlapping, no options available or results different from options), please report them in the "Bugs and Problems" section on the workshop.\n\nEither way, have fun using the toolpack."
 toolpack.1.a:0 "Ok"
 
 #DST
 toolpack.2.d:0 "Trying to find out how this tool works? Here's a quick run through of DST A.\n\nFirst, check the four boxes for each of which you want the specified type to spawn. Check "Infantry" to spawn infantry units, "Cavalry" to spawn cavalry units, etc. You can also check multiple boxes to spawn different division types at once.\n\nNext, check one of the eight boxes below "Battalions per Division". If you check the box at "16", the divisions you spawn will have 16 battalions each. You cannot check multiple boxes here.\n\nNow you should select the state that you want the divisions to spawn in. By marking countries, you can spawn divisions from different nations within the selected state. If no country is marked, the divisions will belong to the country which owns the state. Avoid marking multiple countries when spawning in a state that is not controlled by the owner and do not try to spawn too many divisions for too many countries. Your game will lag like mad. \n\nLast but not least, press one of the four buttons below "Spawn Divisions:" to spawn the specified divisions.\n\nBy pressing the "Delete" button at the bottom right, you can delete all units of the selected type for the selected country."
 toolpack.2.a:0 "Understood."
 toolpack.3.d:0 "Confused? Read this quick run through DST B.\n\nFirst, select a state in which you want to spawn the divisions.\n\nNext, you press the "Create Template" button up to three times to create as many different templates.You will see three boxes appear, named T1, T2 and T3 respectively. These boxes stand for one template each, so T1 stands for "Toolpack-Division", T2 for "Toolpack-Division 2" and T3 for "Toolpack-Division 3". The next step is to edit the template of the country which will receive the division. To switch to a different country, use the command "tag [tag of desired country]". You can normally find a list of all tags under "C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Hearts of Iron IV/common/country_tags/00_countries". Use the two green stars to add or subract army experience.\n\nNow you can specify how well equipped and experienced the divisions should be.\n\nThe second to last step is to define which template you want to spawn. To do this, make checks at T1, T2 or T3 or only two or even all of them.\n\nFinally, you can press any of the four buttons below "Spawn Divisions:" to spawn as many divisions as you want. Keep in mind that you cannot spawn custom divisions of your own country in other countries.\n\nPress the "Delete" button at the bottom right after checking the corresponding boxes to delete all units of all custom templates for the selected country.\n\nWhat you cannot do with this tool: \n- Editing templates in one country and spawning the edited templates in another\n- Spawning renamed templates"
 
 #SST
 toolpack.4.d:0 "Here's how the "Ship Spawning Tool" works:\n\nStep 1: Select one of the six different regions (the ships will spawn in a port within the center of the sea).\n\nStep 2: Select the different ships you want to spawn.\n\nStep 3: Click on a state owned by the country that should receive the ships.\n\nStep 4: Press one of the four buttons to spawn the desired amount of ships."
 
 #MST
 toolpack.5.t:0 "The Manpower/Population Tool"
 toolpack.5.d:0 "The MPT comes in two slightly different tools. The first is the MMT, which is used to manipulate the manpower of countries. Select the "Country" option to either add or remove manpower to or from a country directly or first manipulate one of the two variables to then add its value to selected countries as manpower.\nWith the PMT, you can manage the population of selected states - again, either directly or by changing the variables first.\n\nProblems you will encounter: The four variables that can be edited with the tool cannot go beyond 2147k or -2147k. That is because their value actually becomes its negative when going further from 0 than 2.147m. This is also the reason why some countries' or states' values look completely butchered. Blame Paradox."
